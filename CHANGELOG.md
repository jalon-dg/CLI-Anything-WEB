## [Unreleased]

### Added

Auth-enabled: upvote, submit, comment, favorite, hide, view favorites/submissions/threads. Uses Firebase REST API + Algolia search + HN web forms. 61 tests (31 unit + 30 E2E).
- **cli-web-youtube** — 11th CLI. Search videos, get video details (views, duration, keywords), browse trending by category, explore channels. Uses YouTube's InnerTube REST API. No auth required.
- **Review step in Phase 4** — Standards skill now dispatches 3 parallel review agents (Traffic Fidelity, HARNESS Compliance, Output & UX) before the structural checklist and publish steps.
- **Flair support for cli-web-reddit** — `submit flairs <subreddit>` lists available flairs, `--flair ID` on `submit text`/`submit link`.
