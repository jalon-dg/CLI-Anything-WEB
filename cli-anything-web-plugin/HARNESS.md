# HARNESS.md — CLI-Anything-Web Methodology

**Making Closed-Source Web Apps Agent-Native via Network Traffic Analysis**

This is the methodology overview. Each phase is implemented by a dedicated skill.
Read this file for the big picture; read the relevant skill for phase details.

## Core Philosophy

CLI-Anything-Web builds production-grade Python CLI interfaces for closed-source web
applications by observing their live HTTP traffic. We capture real API calls directly
from the browser, reverse-engineer the API surface, and generate a stateful CLI that
sends authentic HTTP requests to the real service.

The output: a Python CLI under `cli_web/<app>/` with Click commands, `--json` output,
REPL mode, auth management, session state, and comprehensive tests.

### Design Principles

1. **Authentic Integration** — The CLI sends real HTTP requests to real servers.
   No mocks, no reimplementations, no toy replacements.
2. **Dual Interaction** — Every CLI has REPL mode + subcommand mode.
3. **Agent-Native** — `--json` flag on every command. `--help` self-docs.
   Agents discover tools via `which cli-web-<app>`.
4. **Zero Compromise** — Tests fail (not skip) when auth is missing or endpoints
   are unreachable.
5. **Structured Output** — JSON for agents, human-readable tables for interactive use.

### Error Handling Architecture

Every generated CLI MUST include `core/exceptions.py` with a domain-specific exception
hierarchy — typed exceptions enable retry logic, proper CLI exit codes, and structured
JSON error responses. See `references/exception-hierarchy-example.py` for the complete
template. Required types: `AppError` (base), `AuthError` (recoverable flag),
`RateLimitError` (retry_after), `NetworkError`, `ServerError` (status_code), `NotFoundError`.

### Exponential Backoff & Polling

Operations taking >2 seconds MUST use exponential backoff polling (2s→10s, factor 1.5,
timeout 300s) — never fixed `time.sleep()`. Generation commands also need rate-limit
retry (60s→300s backoff on 429). See `references/polling-backoff-example.py` for both
patterns.

### Progress & Output

Use `rich>=13.0` for spinners/progress bars in interactive mode. Suppress in `--json`
mode. See `references/rich-output-example.py` for patterns.

### JSON Error Response Format

When `--json` is active, errors MUST also be JSON — not plain text to stderr:

```python
# Success:
{"success": true, "data": {...}}

# Error:
{"error": true, "code": "AUTH_EXPIRED", "message": "Session expired. Run: cli-web-<app> auth login"}
{"error": true, "code": "RATE_LIMITED", "message": "Rate limited. Retry after 60s", "retry_after": 60}
{"error": true, "code": "NOT_FOUND", "message": "Notebook abc123 not found"}
```

Error codes map directly from the exception hierarchy:
`AuthError` → `AUTH_EXPIRED`, `RateLimitError` → `RATE_LIMITED`, `NotFoundError` → `NOT_FOUND`,
`ServerError` → `SERVER_ERROR`, `NetworkError` → `NETWORK_ERROR`.

## Tool Hierarchy (strict priority)

### Phase 1: Traffic Capture (Developer)

| Priority | Tool | When to use |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 1. PRIMARY | `npx @playwright/cli@latest` via Bash | Traffic recording, tracing |
| 2. FALLBACK | `mcp__chrome-devtools__*` MCP tools | Only if playwright-cli unavailable |
| 3. NEVER | `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` | Blocked — cannot capture request bodies |

### Generated CLI: Auth Login (End-User)

| Tool | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| Python `sync_playwright()` | `auth login` command — opens browser for Google/SSO login |
| `curl_cffi` with `impersonate` | Runtime HTTP for anti-bot protected sites (Unsplash, ProductHunt) |
| `httpx` | Runtime HTTP for unprotected sites and JSON APIs |

> **CRITICAL**: Generated CLIs use Python `sync_playwright()` for auth login,
> NOT `npx @playwright/cli`. The npx approach has interactive input race conditions
> on Windows. See `auth-strategies.md` Known Pitfalls.

### Development vs End-User

| | Development (Phases 1-4) | End-User (published CLI) |
|--|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Browser** | npx playwright-cli manages its own | Python sync_playwright() (auth only) |
| **Traffic capture** | `tracing-start` → browse → `tracing-stop` | N/A — CLI uses httpx/curl_cffi |
| **Auth** | `state-save` after user logs in | `auth login` → sync_playwright context → storage_state → parse cookies |
| **Runtime HTTP** | N/A | httpx or curl_cffi — no browser needed |
| **Dependencies** | Node.js + npx | click, httpx (or curl_cffi), playwright (auth only) |

**The generated CLI MUST work standalone** — a CLI that requires a running browser
defeats the purpose of having a CLI. Python playwright is only needed during `auth login`;
all regular commands use httpx.

## Pipeline: Skill Sequence

The 4-phase pipeline is implemented as a chain of skills. Each skill handles its
phases and invokes the next when done. Hard gates prevent skipping.

| Phase | Skill | What it does | Hard Gate |
|-------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | `capture` | Assess site + capture traffic + explore + save auth | playwright-cli available (or public API shortcut) |
| 2 | `methodology` | Analyze + Design + Implement CLI | raw-traffic.json exists |
| 3 | `testing` | Write tests + document results | Implementation complete |
| 4 | `standards` | Publish, verify, smoke test, generate Claude skill | All tests pass |

> **Phase numbering:** The pipeline has 4 phases: Capture=1, Methodology=2,
> Testing=3, Standards=4. The standards phase includes an implementation
> review step (3 parallel agents) before the structural checklist and publish.

**Sequencing:**
```
capture → methodology → testing → standards → DONE
```

### Parallelism Strategy

Phases are sequential. Within each phase, dispatch independent file writes as
parallel subagents. Core modules (exceptions → client → auth → models) must be
sequential. Command modules and test files are independent — write them in parallel.
Never parallelize writes to the same file.

### Prerequisites

**Primary: playwright-cli (recommended)**

playwright-cli auto-launches and manages its own browser. No manual setup needed.
Just verify Node.js and npx are available:
```bash
npx @playwright/cli@latest --version
```
If this fails, install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

**Fallback: Chrome Debug Profile (if playwright-cli unavailable)**

If playwright-cli cannot be used, fall back to chrome-devtools-mcp:
1. Launch: `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/launch-chrome-debug.sh <url>`
2. Log into the target web app (cookies persist across restarts)
3. Agent uses `mcp__chrome-devtools__*` tools instead

## Reference Materials

These reference files provide detailed patterns for specific topics. They live
under `skills/*/references/` and are loaded when the relevant skill activates.

### Capture References (`skills/capture/references/`)

| Reference | When to read | Used in |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `playwright-cli-commands.md` | **READ FIRST** — correct syntax, timeouts, ESM rules | Phase 1 |
| `playwright-cli-tracing.md` | Trace file format, lifecycle management, recovery protocol | Phase 1 |
| `playwright-cli-sessions.md` | Named sessions, auth persistence | Phase 1 |

| `framework-detection.md` | Site fingerprint command, SSR framework detection | Phase 1 |
| `protection-detection.md` | Checking anti-bot protections during capture | Phase 1 |
| `api-discovery.md` | Finding API endpoints, decision tree, strategy details | Phase 1 |

### Capture Scripts (`scripts/`)

| Script | Purpose | When to use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `phase-state.py` | Track all 4 pipeline phases — skip completed, retry failed | Before each phase, prevents re-running expensive work |
| `capture-checkpoint.py` | Save/restore capture session state (within Phase 1) | Resume interrupted captures, prevent duplicate work |
| `parse-trace.py` | Convert trace files → raw-traffic.json | After `tracing-stop` (default capture method) |
| `mitmproxy-capture.py` | Optional proxy-based capture — no body truncation, real-time noise filtering, dedup, enhanced metadata (timestamps, cookies, body sizes). Supports `start-proxy`/`stop-proxy` for agent-driven browsing. Activated with `--mitmproxy` flag. Requires `pip install mitmproxy` (Python 3.12+). | When `--mitmproxy` flag is passed to `/cli-anything-web` |
| `analyze-traffic.py` | Analyze raw-traffic.json → protocol/endpoint detection. v1.3.0 adds request sequence, session lifecycle, and endpoint size analysis when enhanced fields are present. | Auto-run by parse-trace.py or mitmproxy-capture.py |
| `extract-browser-cookies.py` | Cookie extraction utility | During auth implementation |

### Methodology References (`skills/methodology/references/`)

| Reference | When to read | Used in |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `traffic-patterns.md` | Phase 2 — identifying API protocol (REST, GraphQL, SSR, batchexecute) | Phase 2 |
| `auth-strategies.md` | Phase 2 — implementing auth module | Phase 2 |
| `google-batchexecute.md` | Phase 2 — when target is a Google app | Phase 2 |
| `ssr-patterns.md` | Phase 2 — when target uses SSR (Next.js, Nuxt, etc.) | Phase 2 |
| `helpers-module-example.py` | Phase 2 — implementing utils/helpers.py | Phase 2 |
| `persistent-context-example.py` | Phase 2 — persistent context commands | Phase 2 |

## Critical Rules

- Auth: `chmod 600 auth.json`, never hardcode. Tests fail (not skip) without auth.
- Every command supports `--json` (on each command, not just group). REPL propagates via `ctx.obj`.
- E2E tests include subprocess tests via `_resolve_cli()`.
- README.md and TEST.md required in every CLI package.
- REPL is default (`invoke_without_command=True`). Use unified `repl_skin.py`.
- Generation: `--wait` + `--retry N` + `--output path`. CAPTCHAs pause and prompt.

### Auth Resilience

Auth module must support: (1) env var `CLI_WEB_<APP>_AUTH_JSON` for CI/CD,
(2) auto-refresh with single retry on 401/403 (never more than once),
(3) `use <id>` / `status` context commands for stateful apps.
See `auth-strategies.md` for all implementation patterns.

**CRITICAL: `.google.com` cookies must override regional duplicates** (e.g., `.google.co.il`).
This is the #1 auth bug for international users. See `auth-strategies.md` "Cookie domain priority".

### Implementation Patterns (Reference Files)

These patterns are documented in reference files — read them during implementation, don't reinvent:

| Pattern | Reference | Key |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Exception hierarchy | `exception-hierarchy-example.py` | AppError → AuthError, RateLimitError, etc. |
| Client architecture | `client-architecture-example.py` | Sub-clients for 3+ resources |
| Polling/backoff | `polling-backoff-example.py` | --wait, --retry, rate limit retry |
| Helpers module | `helpers-module-example.py` | handle_errors(), partial ID, _resolve_cli() |
| Persistent context | `persistent-context-example.py` | use/status commands, context.json |
| Rich output | `rich-output-example.py` | Tables, spinners, JSON error output |
| Auth strategies | `auth-strategies.md` | All auth patterns, cookie priority, env var |

## Lessons Learned (cross-reference)

These lessons are documented in detail in the skill/reference where they're most
actionable. This section is a quick-reference index — read the linked file for
full context and code examples.

| Bug / Gotcha | Reference | Fix |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Auth login via npx fails on Windows | `auth-strategies.md` | Use Python `sync_playwright()` with persistent context |
| `.google.co.il` cookies override `.google.com` | `auth-strategies.md` | `.google.com` cookies take priority over regional |
| `load_cookies()` gets list vs dict format | `auth-strategies.md` | Handle both `[{name,value}]` and `{name: value}` |
| RPC IDs reused for different operations | `google-batchexecute.md` | Always verify against traffic, never guess |
| `httpx` → 401/403 on previously working site | `protection-detection.md` | Site added Cloudflare — switch to `curl_cffi` |
| SSR slug URLs return 404 with bare IDs | `ssr-patterns.md` | Search first for canonical slug |
| Windows garbled output | `methodology/SKILL.md` | `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8")` at entry |

## Naming Conventions

| Convention | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| CLI command | `cli-web-<app>` |
| Python namespace | `cli_web.<app>` |
| App-specific SOP | `<APP>.md` |
| Plugin slash command | `/cli-anything-web` |
| Traffic capture dir | `traffic-capture/` |
| Auth config dir | `~/.config/cli-web-<app>/` |
| App names | No hyphens. Underscores OK (`monday_com`) |
